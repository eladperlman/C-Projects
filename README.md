PASS4

Description: This is a 2D game where the player will be shown a side-view, single-screen platformer level made up blocks.  
These blocks come in a variety of types including a goal flag, brick walls, blocks with spikes coming from the bottom, 
left and right, locked doors and pushable crates. The player must then navigate the level to collect all the gems and keys, 
if necessary, and then make their way to the level-end goal.
